A na√Øve implementation of sums-of-squares (SoS) polynomial optimization through semidefinite programming (SDP). Powered by JuMP and Julia. 

## Requirements

To use this package, you'll need an SDP solver with a JuMP interface. If you installed Mayday with `Pkg.add()`, then you've already gotten `SCS.jl`, a wrapper for the free SCS solver, and you're all set. You can also choose to install the `Mosek.jl` package if you want to use  Mosek, a proprietary solver. Mosek requires a license, but is free for academic use: <https://mosek.com/introduction/buy-mosek> and is generally faster.
