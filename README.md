Mayday.jl is a na√Øve implementation of sums-of-squares (SoS) polynomial optimization through semidefinite programming (SDP), powered by JuMP and Julia. 

SoS programming is used in control theory to search for controllers for a dynamical system (like a robot or airplane) and to find the set of states for which those controllers will be valid. To learn more about how SoS programming is used, check out <http://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/underactuated.html?chapter=11>

## Requirements

To use this package, you'll need an SDP solver with a JuMP interface. If you installed Mayday with `Pkg.add()`, then you've already gotten `SCS.jl`, a wrapper for the free SCS solver, and you're all set. You can also choose to install the `Mosek.jl` package if you want to use  Mosek, a proprietary solver. Mosek requires a license, but is free for academic use: <https://mosek.com/introduction/buy-mosek> and is generally faster. 

## Installation

	julia> Pkg.clone("https://github.com/rdeits/Mayday.jl.git")

## Usage

Check out the `examples` folder for demonstrations.
